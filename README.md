## Introduction
KeepCalm is an engaging and interactive game designed for both iPhone and iPad. The game uses the device motion data to control a character's movements, making it an ??fun?? and immersive experience for players. Players collect fruits while avoiding red poo that impose penalties. The game features a start screen, gameplay, and a ranking system where players can save their scores and initials.

## Human-Computer Interaction Experience
The game is designed with a focus on an intuitive and smooth human-computer interaction experience. Key aspects include:
- **Motion Control:** Players use the motion data from their devices to control the character's jumps.
- **Feedback:** Visual and haptic feedback are provided to enhance the user experience. Haptic feedback is used when the player jumps (iPhone only).
- **UI Design:** The interface includes clear and accessible buttons for starting the game and saving scores. A scrollable ranking list ensures easy navigation through high scores.
